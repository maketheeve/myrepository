  <p><strong>Last updated on Aug 19th, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Make The Eve believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">1) Cancellation Requests</h2>
  <ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
    <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within <strong>1–2 days</strong> of placing the order.</li>
    <li>Requests may not be entertained if the order has been communicated to vendors/merchants and shipping has been initiated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">2) Non‑Cancellable Items</h2>
  <p>BnB does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers and eatables. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is not good.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">3) Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
  <p>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at their end. This should be reported within <strong>1–2 days</strong> of receipt of the products.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">4) Product Not as Described</h2>
  <p>If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our Customer Service within <strong>1–2 days</strong> of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team, after reviewing your complaint, will take an appropriate decision.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">5) Manufacturer Warranty</h2>
  <p>In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #34495e; margin-top: 18px;">6) Refund Timelines</h2>
  <p>In case of any refunds approved by BnB, it will take <strong>1–2 working days</strong> for the refund to be processed to the end customer. Actual credit timelines may depend on your bank or payment provider.</p>
